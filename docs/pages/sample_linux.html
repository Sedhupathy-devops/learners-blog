         <h1>More about Linux</h1>
        
         <p class="para-content">Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, 
             but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.
              Because of the dominance of the Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux also has the 
              largest installed base of all general-purpose operating system.
               Although Linux is used by only around 2.3 percent of desktop computers,
               the Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS, dominates the US K-12
                education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.
                Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operating systems 
                are Linux),
                leads other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers (since November 2017, having gradually eliminated all competitors)
